## TODO 🔧

### Bugs 🐞

### Improvements 💡

 - options link should be renamed (variant, context ???) because conflit with json schema link and link ctrl
 - noValid should be the default in forms
 - formatter should be a component?
 - allow icon with input to avoid unicode and translation
 - separate input and output options
 - allow children in docs and examples (ctrl case)
 - allow to see other tests variants
 - remove or minimize lang support
 - remove non bootstrap options support, minimize options and review settings
